                <p>My name is Ayesha Shifana, and I am the proud creator and cake artist behind Frosted. I was born in the beautiful city of Mangalore, Karnataka. 
                    Currently, I'm pursuing my passion for Engineering alongside running my website. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Baking has been my ultimate passion ever since I was a child, and the joy of baking cakes has always held a special place in my heart. It was during the challenging year of 2020, amidst the lockdown period, that I decided to turn my beloved hobby into a business. 
                        The overwhelming love and appreciation I received from my neighbors and friends who tasted my cakes encouraged me to take this step, and that's how Frosted came into existence.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> Being deeply fond of art and design, I found a wonderful avenue to express my creativity through designing cakes.
                             Crafting unique and artistic cake designs has been a delightful journey, and my ultimate goal is to create cakes that not only captivate the eyes but also leave a lasting impression on the taste buds.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Frosted is based in the vibrant city of Bangalore, and our purpose is to spread happiness and create cherished memories for our clients. 
                            Each order received fills me with immense gratitude, and I am truly thankful for every opportunity to showcase my skills and bring joy to others through my small business.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Your interest and support mean the world to me, and I'm excited to share my passion for baking with you. Together, let's make life a little sweeter, one cake at a time. 
                            Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being a part of this wonderful journey with Frosted.</p>
                            <p> Thank You</p><br>
